Each year, climate change’s impact has become more evident through rising sea levels, fluctuating temperatures, unpredictability of weather, and countless other effects that climate change has had on life. \nAs a part of addressing climate change, learning how to adapt society to the impact that it has created has become a priority for many governments in the world. For Singapore, a part of this effort is through Meteorological Service Singapore which collects and maintains national weather records."
