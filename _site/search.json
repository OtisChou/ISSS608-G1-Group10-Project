A slider will also be included to offer users an option to drag from 2013-2023 for a time-frame selection. Lastly, a location option will be implemented with choices from the five main regions in Singapore: Central Region, North Region, North-East Region, East Region and West Region, based on the station that was chosen respectively: Newton, Admiralty, Pulau Ubin, Changi, Jurong (West).\nUnder exploratory analysis, the dashboard will provide a boxplot, dynamic line, bar charts, and heatmaps which will change according to what users choose as a filter to manipulate what is shown on the screen. These descriptive visualizations will provide information through the display of trends throughout the years for selected regions. Additional features include interaction capabilities, such as zoom features and tooltips. For all the graphs, it will correspond to all the categories for this section since they will be under the same format. Confirmatory and predictive modeling will be similar, with different graphs such as a test for confirmatory, and a forecast for prediction purposes."

The changes in temperature from year to year are not statistically significant, suggesting that the temperature has remained relatively stable over the period under consideration, at least within the sensitivity of this model.\nAt the same time, the slope of the line is -0.004621, indicating that the temperature decreases by approximately 0.0046 units for each additional year. However, this is a very small change and may not be practically significant.\nWe can infer that relying solely on temperature data from the past decade to predict future temperatures will likely not result in an increase of 1.4 to 4.6 degrees, as previously suggested by the chart."

However, this is a very small change and may not be practically significant.\nWe can infer that relying solely on temperature data from the past decade to predict future temperatures will likely not result in an increase of 1.4 to 4.6 degrees, as previously suggested by the chart."

This interactive plot also allows users to hover over the chart for different features. The x-axis represents the years, the y-axis displays the annual average mean wind speeds, and different weather stations are distinguished by color. This visual representation allows for a dynamic exploration of how average wind speeds vary across years and different weather stations, providing valuable insights into the wind conditions.\nFrom the graph above, there is nothing unusual about the wind patterns other than Pulau Ubin in 2018 and 2019, and Admiralty in 2020 and 2021."
